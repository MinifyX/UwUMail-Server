# Changelog

Each release gets a section here before its tag is pushed; CI copies the section into the GitHub
release. Versions follow semver; `-beta.N` versions are pre-releases.

## 0.1.0

The first version I use instead of mailcow.

- Mail: SMTP with DKIM, SPF, DMARC, MTA-STS and TLS reports; JMAP; IMAP on port 993 with IDLE,
  CONDSTORE and QRESYNC; calendars and contacts over CalDAV and CardDAV.
- Mail apps: autoconfig, Autodiscover and Apple configuration profiles with their own app password.
- People and domains: aliases, sub-addresses, catch-all, forwarding with confirmation, forwarding
  addresses without a mailbox, sending as a whole domain, app passwords, authenticator apps and
  passkeys.
- Spam filter: rules, reputation, Bayes, greylisting, sender lists with patterns, word lists,
  built-in lists and limits per person.
- UwUMail Gateway: a VPS in front of a server at home, over a QUIC tunnel.
- Moving from mailcow: export script, import of people with their password hashes, aliases,
  settings, DKIM keys, calendars and contacts, and copying mail over IMAP.
- Backups: nightly to SFTP, deduplicated and encrypted, with restore from the command line.
- Updates: the portal shows new versions of the chosen channel and the commands to update.
